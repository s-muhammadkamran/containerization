# Typical Dockerfile Format

LABEL version="1.0"     # Adds meta data

FROM node:18 AS build   # Choose a base image and name a build stage

ENV Key=Value           # Set environment variable in key value. For more environment variable add more ENV tags

WORKDIR /myapp          # Create and change to a Working Dir in container

COPY . /myapp           # Copy all files from current location in host to container

RUN npm install         # Run a command in container

EXPOSE 3000             # Expose a port

VOLUME /data            # Declare a mount point for external storage

USER node               # Sets the user for following instructions and container execution

ARG APP_VERSION 1.0.0   # Declares build-time variables (not available at runtime)

CMD ["npm", "start"]    # Run commands as list in container

HEALTHCHECK CMD cur     # Define a command to check container health
-- fail http://localhost:3000 || exit 1



## Example Dockerfile combining everything:

FROM node:18 AS build
LABEL maintainer="kamran@example.com"
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . /app
RUN npm run build

FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
